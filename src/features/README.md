# Features Directory

This directory contains domain-specific feature components organized by business domain:

## Structure

- **auth/** - Authentication and user registration components
- **cart/** - Shopping cart functionality
- **products/** - Product browsing, search, and filtering
- **orders/** - Order history and management
- **checkout/** - Checkout process and payment

## Organization Principles

Each feature directory should contain:
- Feature-specific components
- Feature-specific hooks
- Feature-specific utilities
- Feature-specific types
- Tests for the feature
- Documentation specific to the feature

## Benefits

- **Clear separation of concerns** - each feature is self-contained
- **Easier maintenance** - related code is grouped together
- **Better scalability** - new features can be added easily
- **Improved developer experience** - easier to find and modify code
- **Better testing** - features can be tested in isolation
