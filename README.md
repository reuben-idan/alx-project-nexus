## Project Objective
- Consolidate key learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering** curriculum.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions in one place.
- Provide a living reference for current and future learners.
- Foster productive collaboration between **frontend** and **backend** cohorts.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Documentation** – RESTful APIs, GraphQL, Message Queues, CI/CD Pipelines, Celery & RabbitMQ, System Design, and more.
- **Real-World Challenges** – Detailed accounts of obstacles encountered during labs and projects, plus the rationale behind implemented fixes.
- **Best Practices & Takeaways** – Industry standards coupled with personal insights that proved valuable in production-like scenarios.
- **Collaboration Hub** – Guidelines and channels to streamline teamwork across ProDev tracks.

## Technologies Covered
| Category | Tools & Frameworks |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Languages | Python 3, Shell (Bash), SQL |
| Frameworks | Django, Django REST Framework, Graphene-Django |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Messaging | Celery, RabbitMQ |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, Jenkins |
| Testing | pytest, Django Test Runner |

## Core Backend Concepts
- Database Design & ORM‐driven data modeling
- REST vs GraphQL API design
- Authentication & Authorization schemes (JWT, OAuth2)
- Asynchronous programming & task queues
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Observability: logging, metrics, and tracing
- Horizontal vs Vertical scaling considerations

## Challenges & Solutions
> *This section is continuously updated as the journey progresses.*

| Challenge | Solution |
| --------- | -------- |
| Docker networking issues between Django & RabbitMQ | Added an explicit `bridge` network and health-checks in *docker-compose.yml*. |
| Long-running tasks blocking requests | Offloaded heavy operations to **Celery** workers, returning immediate 202 responses. |
| Inconsistent environments across team devices | Introduced **devcontainer.json** and a standardized **Makefile**. |

## Best Practices & Takeaways
- Keep API contracts versioned and documented (OpenAPI / Swagger).
- Automate *everything*: tests, linting, builds, and deployments.
- Write idempotent database migrations.
- Monitor key metrics early—**you can’t improve what you don’t measure**.
- Favour composition over inheritance in Django models when feasible.

## Collaboration Guide
### Who to Collaborate With
- **ProDev Frontend Learners** – they consume the APIs you build; establish feedback loops early.
- **ProDev Backend Peers** – pair-program, review PRs, and share debugging tactics.

### Where to Collaborate
- **Discord**: Join `#ProDevProjectNexus` to brainstorm, ask questions, and stay on top of staff announcements.

> 💡 **ProDev Tip:** During the first week, declare your chosen project and find FE partners targeting the same domain to ensure seamless integration.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/reuben-idan/alx-project-nexus.git

# Navigate into the project
$ cd alx-project-nexus

# (Optional) Set up Python environment
$ python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dev dependencies (update as needed)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The repository is *documentation-first*; code samples live under `/examples` and `/snippets` as they are discussed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed! Please open an issue or submit a PR adhering to the following:
1. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/my-topic`).
2. Write clear, concise documentation and code samples.
3. Ensure the Markdown linter passes (`markdownlint`).
4. Describe **why** the change is valuable in the PR template.
