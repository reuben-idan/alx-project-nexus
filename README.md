# Everything Grocery E-Commerce Platform Documentation

## Overview

This repository serves as documentation for my build of the "Everything Grocery" dynamic e-commerce product catalog, as part of the ProDev Frontend Engineering program. The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario where developers balance functional requirements, scalable architecture, and user experience for a modern grocery shopping application accessible via web, mobile, or PWA.

---

## Project Objective

- **API Integration:** Fetch, display, and synchronize product data dynamically from backend APIs.
- **User Convenience:** Implement rich filtering and sorting for seamless product discovery.
- **Performance Optimization:** Support high-traffic scenarios with pagination and infinite scrolling.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Ensure an inclusive, responsive UI across devices.
- **Maintainable Frontend:** Leverage modern technologies for scalability and clean codebase.

## Project Goals

- **Build a scalable product catalog frontend using modern technologies.**
- **Optimize for performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.**
- **Provide seamless navigation, filtering, and product discovery.**
- **Document process for future reference and collaboration.**

---

## Tech Stack

- **React / React Native:** Component-based architecture for web and mobile.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Predictable, scalable state management and async flows.
- **TypeScript:** Static typing for reliability and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS for rapid responsive UI.
- **API Integration:** RESTful endpoints for product data.

---

## Key Features

### 1. API Data Integration

- Dynamic fetching of product catalog from backend API.
- Robust error boundaries and loading states for smooth UX.

### 2. Filtering and Sorting

- **Category Filtering:** Users can select categories to view relevant products.
- **Price Sorting:** Sort products by ascending or descending prices.
- **Multi-Criteria Filters:** Combine filters for refined search results.

### 3. Pagination and Infinite Scrolling

- **Pagination:** Numbered navigation to browse products in chunks.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Auto-load more products as users scroll for continuous browsing.

### 4. Responsive Design

- Layout adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and flexible grid systems.

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                    | Solution Approach                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| API Latency & Errors         | Implemented loading skeletons, retry logic, error boundaries. |
| Complex Filtering Logic      | Utilized memoized selectors and composable filter functions in Redux. |
| Infinite Scrolling           | Leveraged Intersection Observer API and Redux middleware for dynamic loading. |
| Responsive UI on Legacy Browsers | Applied progressive enhancement and CSS polyfills.       |
| State Synchronization        | Centralized logic using Redux Toolkit and React Query for data fetching. |
| Accessibility                | Ensured semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and proper ARIA roles. |
| Commit Discipline            | Adopted Conventional Commit messages and frequent atomic commits. |
